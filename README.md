Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
========================================
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Steps on How the script works
========================================
1. Download the dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. Unzipping, you should have UCI HAR Dataset folder on your system.
2. In R, set your working directory to the UCI HAR Dataset folder and run the file run_analysis.R in the parent folder.
3. As the result of the analysis you should have " Tidy_data.txt" text file created in your working directory.
